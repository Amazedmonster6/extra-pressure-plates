Thanks to Draylar and others for the code of the mod and it's entirety, I did not make this mod by myself and I give all credit to Draylar, I just thought the mod was so cool and I wanted to update it to 1.16.3 but there were some issues I had to solve but for now 1.1.5 snapshot is the latest, here is the link to Drayler's source and the other released versions.

license is MIT = do what you want

Plans:

add more pressure plates like stone bricks, mossy bricks, cobble, diamond, netherite, mod support plates ,etc :)
